# Notes From Email

- This take home task should be pretty straight forward and the prompt is open-ended on purpose. We recommend spending no more than about 3 hrs on this project. External boilerplates and libraries are allowed and please document them as such.

- We recommend taking approximately 3 hrs, but please be sure to submit a complete and working solution; incomplete solutions cannot progress to the next round. This exercise is designed to provide insight into your programming and Go proficiency so please keep that in mind as you work on your submission.

- Given the open-ended nature of the prompt, good solutions should demonstrate separation of concerns, proficiency with utilizing data stores, and practice idiomatic Go.

- The code submitted for the take-home project will be the boilerplate for the onsite project.

- Please include a README file (again open-ended on purpose for whatever theyâ€™d like the reviewer to know, ex. I spent 14 hrs making this perfect even tho only supposed to be 2)

- There is a document attached to this email that has all of the components that you will need to complete this task.

- Please reply to this email to give me a rough estimate on when to expect your task submission. We recommend trying to submit this in 3-5 business days.
